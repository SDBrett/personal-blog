Recently vBrownBag kicked off the APAC podcast with a 4 part series on Cisco';s SDN solution ACI. Before getting into the details of the show I would like to thank our presenters, Lauren Malhoit [@<span class="u-linkComplex-target">malhoit</span>](https://twitter.com/malhoit){.ProfileHeaderCard-screennameLink.u-linkComplex.js-nav} and Carl Niger [@<span class="u-linkComplex-target">carl_niger</span>](https://twitter.com/carl_niger){.ProfileHeaderCard-screennameLink.u-linkComplex.js-nav} for taking the time to put together some fantastic content and presenting at a local time when most of us would be asleep.

The series provided excellent product information on Cisco';s SDN solution as well a great a technical overview of the components and some of its capabilities.
