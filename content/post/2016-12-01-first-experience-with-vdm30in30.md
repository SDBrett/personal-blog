VDM30in30 is a challenge from the Virtual Design Master crew. The aim is to produce 30 pieces of content in 30 days. This content can be in any format. If you don';t reach the 30, that';s ok.

I did not reach the goal of 30 new content pieces. I ended up with 16 blog posts and 2 videos. The videos can be found on [here](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL2rC-8e38bUVOzSCM_1Yswazvrq1De8QY).

#### Experience with VDM30in30

Prior to VDM30in30, my blog only had 30 posts. As a result, there are now 46 posts. Rather a significant jump. But I don';t feel post count is the metric to be used for judging success.

By having a goal to publish more content, I was thinking of different ways to get content out. Due to this, I found new types of articles to write and started to feel more confident in what I wrote.

To improve writing skills, you must write more. VDM30in30 has helped my writing significantly. Through changing post styles, I have managed to learn how to my use of writing language has improved. Reviews, for example, have assisted with balanced criticism.

To keep this concise. The results of participating are:

  * Increased views
  * Increased followers
  * Improved confidence in publishing
  * Better understanding of writing styles
  * Written language skills significantly improved
  * Found new blogs

#### To the other VDM30in30 participants

To all who participated, you';re all bloody legends. I';m hoping that you all got as much out if it as I did. I read as many posts as time out allow and the content has been amazing.
