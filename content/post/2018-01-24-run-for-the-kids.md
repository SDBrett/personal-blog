On the 18th of March, VMware staff members from the Melbourne office will be taking part in the Run for the Kids charity race. By particiapting in the either the 5 or 15 KM events, we will be raising much needed funds for the Good Friday Appeal.

The Good Friday Appeal is an annual charity drive to raise money for the Royal Children's Hospital in Melbourne. Last year it managed to raise $17,605,665. 

While registrations fees go towards the Good Friday Appeal, there is still a fundraising effort to be made. Last year, Run for the Kids raised $1.6M and had 26,000 participate in the event.  Like any charity event, we hope to beat that figure. 

If you would like to help us raise money for this great cause, please follow this [link](https://runforthekids2018.everydayhero.com/au/vmware) to the VMware Team fundraising page and donate. Dentations made to individual team members will contribute to the teams total. 

Below are some excerpts from the Run for the Kids and Royal Children's Hospital sites to help provide additional information.

#### Run for the Kids

The Herald Sun/CityLink Run for the Kids is a community event, and its primary aim is to raise funds for the Royal Children's Hospital Good Friday Appeal.

The Herald and Weekly Times, through its flagship newspaper, the Herald Sun, has had a long and proud association with the Good Friday Appeal. The Appeal originated in 1931 when a group of Herald and Weekly Times' employees got together with sports officials to run a sports carnival that raised money for the hospital, then struggling in the grip of the Great Depression.

The Appeal was maintained, funded and nurtured by the Herald and Weekly Times, and since 1956, by television partner Channel Seven.

After a spectacular debut in 2006, the Herald Sun &#124; CityLink Run for the Kids has grown to one of Victoria's largest mass-participation fun runs with participants experiencing a tremendous thrill running over a great course for a great cause.

The event is proud of its position as the single biggest fundraising contributor for the Royal Children's Hospital Good Friday Appeal. To date the event has raised over $15.6 million dollars for the Appeal.

The Royal Children's Hospital improves the health and wellbeing of children and adolescents through leadership in healthcare, research and education. Nearly all families come into direct contact with the work of the hospital at some stage, either through the care of their own children or through friends or family.

We are the major specialist paediatric hospital in Victoria and our care extends to children from Tasmania, southern New South Wales and other states around Australia and overseas.

We are the designated state-wide major trauma centre for paediatrics in Victoria and a Nationally Funded Centre for cardiac and liver transplantation.

When it comes to training and research we partner with the very best. Our campus partners, the Murdoch Childrens Research Institute (MCRI) and The University of Melbourne Department of Paediatrics, along with the RCH Foundation, are on site with the hospital in Parkville. Together, we are committed to improving the health outcomes for children today and in the future.
